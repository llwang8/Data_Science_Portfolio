    "In this guided project, we'll work with stock market data that was downloaded from Yahoo Finance using the yahoo_finance Python package. This data consists of the daily stock prices from 2007-1-1 to 2017-04-17 for several hundred stock symbols traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange, stored in the prices folder. The download_data.py script in the same folder as the Jupyter notebook was used to download all of the stock price data. Each file in the prices folder is named for a specific stock symbol, and contains the:\n",
    "\n",
    "date -- date that the data is from.\n",
    "close -- the closing price on that day, which is the price when the trading day ends.\n",

    "high -- the highest price the stock reached during trading.\n",
    "low -- the lowest price the stock reached during trading.\n",
