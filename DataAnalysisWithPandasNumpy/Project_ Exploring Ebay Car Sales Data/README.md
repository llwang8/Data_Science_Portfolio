## Project
# Exploring Ebay Used Car Sales Data

In this project, I work with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.  The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle.

The aim of this project is to clean up the data and analyze the included used car listings.

Data cleaning involves changing column names and datatype, removing outliers and invalid entries, and map German words in categorical data to their English counterparts. Also I explore the mean price and mileage of top car brands, find the most common brand/model combination, and discover correlation of average price to different odometer bin groups.
