    "The dataset contains 1058 responses to an online survey about what Americans eat for Thanksgiving dinner. Each survey respondent was asked questions about what they typically eat for Thanksgiving, along with some demographic questions, like their gender, income, and location. This dataset will allow us to discover regional and income-based patterns in what Americans eat for Thanksgiving dinner.\n",

For example, one of the first column names is What is typically the main dish at your Thanksgiving dinner?. The potential responses are:\n",
