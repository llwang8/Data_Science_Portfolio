## Project
# Predicting House Sale Prices

In this project, I practice what I learned about approaches to model fitting, and techniques for cleaning, transforming, and selecting features by exploring ways to improve the linear regression model built in the course of Linear Regression for Machine Learning.  I also experiment with different k-fold to achieve the optimal LinearRegression model.

I'll work with housing data for the city of Ames, Iowa, United States from 2006 to 2010. You can also read about the different columns in the data _[here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)_.


### Built with:

Python, Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, LinearRegression, KFold, mean_square_error, and Anaconda Jupyter Notebook.
