## Project
# Predict Car Prices

In this project, I'll explore the work flow of machine learning using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to predict a car's market price using its attributes. First build a train/test model to experiment using different sets of features and k neighbors.  Then use a k-fold cross validation model to experiment with different k-folds.

The data set contains information on various cars about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, how fast the car accelerates, and more.


### Built with:

Python, Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, KNeighborsReRegressor, and Anaconda Jupyter Notebook.
