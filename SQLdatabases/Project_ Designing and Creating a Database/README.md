## Project
# Designing and Creating a Database

This project works with a file of Major League Baseball games from Retrosheet, which compiles detailed statistics on baseball games from the 1800s through to today.

This project aims to accomplish:
- Import CSV data into a database.
- Design a normalized schema for a large, predominantly single table data set.
- Create tables that match the schema design.
- Migrate data from unnormalized tables into normalized tables



### Built with:

Python, sqlite3 and Anaconda Jupyter Notebook.
