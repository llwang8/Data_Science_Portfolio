## Project
# Analyzing CIA World Factbook with SQLite and Python

In this project, I worked with data from the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/), a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information like:

- population - The population as of 2015.
- population_growth - The annual population growth rate, as a percentage.
 -area - The total land and water area.

This project aims to explore the Python SQLite workflow to analyze and visualize data from this database. I use Pandas to execute SQL queries to summarize population statistics, find outliers, exam population density and explore ratio of water to land distribution.


### Built with:

Python, Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib, and Anaconda Jupyter Notebook.
