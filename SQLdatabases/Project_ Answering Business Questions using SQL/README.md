## Project
# Answering Business Questions Using SQL

This project aims to explore a modified version of a SQLite database called Chinook. The Chinook database contains information about a fictional digital music shop - kind of like a mini-iTunes store.

I use Pandas to execute SQL queries to explore answers to business questions as follows:
- Select which new albums to purchase based on the findings of which genres sell the best in the USA
- Evaluate sales performance by employees or countries based on customers purchase,
- Help company choose purchase strategy by album or popular track through evaluating percentage of purchases by individual track or album.

SQL queries are developed using subqueries, multiple joins, set operations, aggregate function, views and case statement.


### Built with:

Python, Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib, sqlite3 and Anaconda Jupyter Notebook.
