## Project
# Investigating Airplane Accidents

In this project, I work with a data set of airplane accident statistics to analyze patterns and look for any common threads.

The  data set that contains 77,282 aviation accidents that occurred in the U.S., and the metadata associated with them. The data in AviationData.txt file download at data.gov comes from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).

I experiment with brute force search, linear search and log search for special value in the aviation data.
I use dictionary data structure to count up how many accidents occurred in each U.S. state and find the name of the state with the most aviation accidents.
I also use dictionary data structure to count how many fatalities and serious injuries occurred during each unique month and year.
