## Project
# Explore Airplane Accidents

The data in AviationData.txt file comes from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which was downloaded at data.gov. This data set contains 77,282 aviation accidents that occurred in the U.S., and the metadata associated with them.

Accidents are an unfortunate fact of air travel. Although flying is statistically safer than driving, minor and major flying accidents occur daily. In this project, I am using this data set of airplane accident statistics to analyze patterns and look for any common threads.

### Built with:
