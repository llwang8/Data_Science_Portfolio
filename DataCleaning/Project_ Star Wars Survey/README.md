## Project
# Star War Surveys

While waiting for Star Wars: The Force Awakens to come out, the team at FiveThirtyEight became interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. In particular, they wondered: does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?  The team needed to collect data to address this question. To do this, they surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey. They received 835 total responses.

There are several other columns containing answers to questions about the Star Wars movies. For some questions, the respondent had to check one or more boxes. This type of data is difficult to represent in columnar format. As a result, this data set needs a lot of cleaning, which involves removing invalid rows, converting yes/no columns to boolean type, renaming columns for better representation, and converting series of columns to float data types.

After cleaning up data, I proceed to explore the dataset to compare total viewership and ranking of different star war episodes by different demographic factors and fan or not.
