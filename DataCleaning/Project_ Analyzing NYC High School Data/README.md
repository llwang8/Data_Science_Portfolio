## Project
# Analyzing NYC High School Data

New York City has a significant immigrant population and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores is a good way to determine whether the SAT is a fair test.
This project aims to explore relationships between SAT scores and demographic factors in New York City public schools.

First use Pandas to clean up dataset to prepare for further analysis, which involves adding columns, converting columns to numeric, condensing datasets and combining datasets.

Several analysis are done to explore demographic factors in relation to SAT score.  Use dataframe's corr() function to exam how different factors correlate to SAT scores. Then use mpl_toolkits.basemap to map out one of most correlated factors - safety_score over district to further exam school details. Use bar plot to disply racial difference in SAT performance.  Use scatter plot to display how SAT correlated with percentage of students taking AP courses.


### Built with:

Python, Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib, mpl_toolkits.basemap and Anaconda Jupyter Notebook.
