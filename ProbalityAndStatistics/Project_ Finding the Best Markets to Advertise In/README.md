## Project
# Find the Best Market to Advertise in

This project is for a fictional e-learning company that offers courses on web and mobile development, data science, game development, etc. Company wants to promote courses and invest some money in advertisement.  The goal in this project is to find out the two best markets to advertise products in.

It is costly to organize surveys for a couple of different markets to find out which would be the best choices for advertising.  There is one good existing data that might be relevant for the purpose, which is FreeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey.

I start by evaluating if the FreeCodeCamp's survey is representative of the population of interest by examing job interest.  Once confirmed I proceed to find out countries where new coders locate and how much money new coders are willing to spend on learning by compiling relative frequency distribution by countries.  I also investigate outliers and remove them.  I use boxplot to illustrate distribution of money spent per country per month to find out the best markets to advertise in.
