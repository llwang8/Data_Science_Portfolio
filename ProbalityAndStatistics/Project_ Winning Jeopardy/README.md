## Project
# Winning Jeopardy

Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer questions to win money. It's been running for a few decades, and is a major force in popular culture.

Let's say you want to compete on Jeopardy, and you're looking for any edge you can get to win. In this project, I'll work with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help you win.

In order to figure out whether to study past questions, study general knowledge, or not study it all, it would be helpful to figure out two things:
- How often the answer is deducible from the question.
- How often new questions are repeats of older questions.

Also Let's say you only want to study questions that pertain to high value questions instead of low value questions. This will help you earn more money when you're on Jeopardy.  You can actually figure out which terms correspond to high-value questions using a chi-squared test.

This project aims to answer those questions using Python, Pandas, Numpy and Scipy to answer those questions.

The dataset is named jeopardy.csv, and contains 20000 rows from the beginning of a full dataset of Jeopardy questions, which you can download [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/).
