## Project
# Visualizing Earnings Based on College Majors

The dataset is about the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. The original data on job outcomes was released by American Community Survey, which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it on their Github repo.

The project aims to explore college major data on job outcomes using various plotting tools built into pandas. These tools include scatter plots to explore correlations between columns, histogram to examine distribution of columns and bar plots for comparison analysis. Use pivot tables to aggregate data with certain criteria before comparison plotting.


### Built with:

Python, Numpy, matplotlib and Anaconda Jupyter Notebook.
