## Project
# Explore Gun Death in U.S.

The dataset came from FiveThirtyEight, and can be found here (https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data).

The dataset is stored in the guns.csv file. It contains information on gun deaths in the US from 2012 to 2014. Each row in the dataset represents a single fatality. The columns contain demographic and other information about the victim as following : 'year', 'month', 'intent', 'police', 'sex', 'age', 'race', 'hispanic', 'place', 'education'.

In this project, I'll explore the dataset, and try to find patterns in the demographics of the victims.
