## Project
# Explore Gun Deaths in U.S. from 2012 to 2014

The dataset came from FiveThirtyEight, and can be found [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data).
The dataset is stored in the guns.csv file. It contains information on gun deaths in the US from 2012 to 2014. Each row in the dataset represents a single fatality. The columns contain demographic and other information about the victim as following : 'year', 'month', 'intent', 'police', 'sex', 'age', 'race', 'hispanic', 'place', 'education'.

In this project, I try to uncover patterns in the demographics of the victims by using Python to compile gun deaths and homicide distribution in relation to year, month, date, gender, race, education and location.
